## Test Automation Assessment.
### The project tests both web and api, using testng framework

### Tools
For the this project, we used Selenium Webdriver for our gui(web) tests and RESTassured for our api.
The code is written in Java, and it's a Maven project
We user Allure report for reporting.

### Execution
I used to Intellij for the project, and Eclipse should also be fine.

On the project structure under the Test > Resources root, you should find gui and api subfolders that contain testng xml files that can be used to execute the tests. You can select which tests to execute by disabling the ones you do now want to execute

To run the report, under the allure-result folder, highlight the files, right click and open on Terminal. The terminal will open, and execute the this command: allure serve, and the report should open on the default browser.
